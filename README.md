## Description

A new company needs to address these requirements: Create a Node API with Typescript. Connect the Node API to MongoDB using mongoose (desirable models in typescript). We need to develop three endpoints behind a basic authentication (username and password). Create a user with name, last name, address, and profile picture (this should be a file). Retrieve users. Update user. Star point: Dockerize MongoDB and the Node API
